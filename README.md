# Book Search Engine App

This app is a book searching engine built with React using GraphQL and Apollo for the server.
Upon loading the page, the user may type in any book they wish into the search bar, which will then
load all books matching the search parameter. The user can also create an account where they can
save a list of their favorite books, and even remove a book from said list.
